# Description

This node application allows users respond to a series of questions, the answers to which are used to generate an HTML with the input data. The HTML file contains a series of dynamically generated cards that describe the members of the team. All cards will contain the employee's name, role, ID, and email address. Based on the employee's role, other data will also appear in the card: manager cards contain and office number, engineer cards contain a clickable link to their GitHub, and intern cards contain their school.
